This is a repository dedicated to re-creating a select number of machine learning algorithms from scratch, using basic Python and numpy. This is a project I started mainly for fun and to enhance my understanding of the algorithms under the hood. Because of that, the choice of algorithms is relatively arbitrary as I will mostly be doing ones I find particularly interesting. The initial plan is to have each algorithm in a separate notebook, but I may create separate scripts later on to compare them to some sample ML datasets.
